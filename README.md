# BlobStorageManager
In this repository you can find an Blazor app uploading and downloading files to an Azure Storage Account with an ASP.NET Core WebAPI.

These are all the tasks in the example:
* Create a web service including a small web frontend with Blazor where one can upload and download files.
* Host the service in Azure AppServices.
* Store the uploaded files in the cloud on Azure Blob storage.
* Store some metadata about the upload in a cloud-hosted database on Azure PostgreSQL
* Use a build pipeline which creates and deploys the application.
